# Struyckenator

## Overview

This repository contains several modern web-based implementations of algorithmic artworks originally created by Dutch artist [Peter Struycken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Struycken). Struycken is a pioneer in computer art who has been exploring the relationship between mathematics, computation, and visual aesthetics since the 1960s.

The implementations in this repository include:

- **Struycken Algorithm Image Processor**: A recreation of Struycken's famous algorithm used to create the Dutch Queen's postage stamp in the 1980s. This implementation converts grayscale images to unique point patterns with advanced controls for tonal adjustment, point distribution, and visual customization.

- **Geometric Grid**: An interactive recreation of Struycken's geometric grid explorations, featuring dynamic triangular patterns with automatic refreshing.

- **Struyckenizer**: A generative algorithmic pattern creator inspired by Struycken's works with grayscale value gradients.

## AI-Assisted Development

These implementations were developed with the assistance of state-of-the-art AI models:

- Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- OpenAI's GPT-4.1

The AI models assisted in:
- Implementing complex algorithms
- Creating responsive user interfaces
- Developing image processing techniques
- Building interactive controls and visualization capabilities

## Features

Each implementation includes various interactive features:

- Real-time parameter adjustment
- Visual customization options
- Responsive designs for different screen sizes
- Presets and storage capabilities
- Pan and zoom functionality for detailed exploration

## Usage

Open any of the HTML files in the `/public` directory in a modern web browser to explore the different implementations. Each implementation includes its own set of controls and options for creating unique visual experiences.

For more detailed information about specific implementations, refer to the individual documentation files in the `/public` directory.

## Historical Context

Peter Struycken's work represents a significant contribution to the field of computer-generated art. His approach to using algorithms and mathematical principles to create visual compositions has influenced generations of digital artists.

The implementations in this repository aim to preserve and extend his pioneering techniques, making them accessible to a contemporary audience through modern web technologies.
